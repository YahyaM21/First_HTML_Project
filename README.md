World Travel Guide

This site is my first full website.
I plan to create a "Travel guide"

Things that will be included in the HomePage:
- Navigation bar containg all seven continents
- Dropdown menus for each containg the top 5 countries that are visited
- Carousel that contains some of the top tourist countries in the world

Individual pages will contain:
- Jumbotron with country flag and Country name
- Information about 3 of the most popular attractions
- general information about the country(History, Population, Current President or leader)
- Each page will contain a footer that is exactly the same
